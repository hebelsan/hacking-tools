## wfuzz

Wfuzz is a tool designed for brute-forcing web applications. It can be used to find resources not linked directories, servlets, scripts, etc, brute-force GET and POST parameters for checking different kinds of injections (SQL, XSS, LDAP), brute-force forms parameters (user/password) and fuzzing.

### exmaple

```bash
wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://10.10.153.166/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"
```

In the command above:
- `-z` file,usernames.txt loads the usernames list.
- `-z` file,passwords.txt uses the password list generated by CeWL.
- `--hs "Please enter the correct credentials"` hides responses containing the string "Please enter the correct credentials", which is the message displayed for wrong login attempts.
- `-u` specifies the target URL.
- `-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"` provides the POST data format where FUZZ will be replaced by usernames and FUZ2Z by passwords.
