## Port scanning

# Fast scan
nmap -F localhost

# Agressive scan and timing template 4 (aggressive)
nmap -A -T4 localhost

# Scan all ports (or -p-)
nmap -p '*' localhost

# Detect service/daemon versions
nmap -sV localhost

# Scan for vulnerabilities
nmap -Pn --script vuln localhost

# without ping
nmap -Pn localhost

# script scan using a default set of scripts
nmap -sC localhost

# good general aggressive call
nmap -p- -A -sV -sC -Pn -T4 host

# check tls an ssl on https port
nmap -p 443 --script ssl-enum-ciphers host

# it's always a good thing to turn on -v (verbose) to see what is happening

# to speed up the first scan --min-rate=10000
